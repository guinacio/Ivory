ðŸŽ² **Ivory** is a dice game based on the popular Yahtzee game. Roll the dice, aim for specific combinations, and score points to achieve the highest total score at the end of all rounds.

**Please note that Ivory is still in development and may have bugs or incomplete features.**

## How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice:**
   - At the beginning of each round, you get a roll of five dice.
   - You can choose to keep any number of dice and re-roll the others.
   - You can re-roll up to three more times during your turn.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Each round, you must choose a scoring category for your roll.
   - The categories include ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, Ivory, and chance.
   - Once you've chosen a category, you cannot change it for the rest of the game.
   - If your roll meets the requirements of the selected category, you score points based on the combination achieved.

3. **Scoring Categories:**
   - **Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes:** Sum of all dice that show the corresponding number.
   - **Three of a Kind:** Sum of all dice if there are at least three dice with the same number.
   - **Four of a Kind:** Sum of all dice if there are at least four dice with the same number.
   - **Full House:** 25 points if you have three dice of one number and two dice of another number.
   - **Small Straight:** 30 points if you have the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (1-5).
   - **Large Straight:** 40 points if you have the sequence 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (2-6).
   - **Ivory:** 50 points if you have all five dice showing the same number.
   - **Chance:** Sum of all dice, regardless of the combination.

4. **End of the Game:**
   - After 13 rounds, the game ends, aim to achieve the highest score and break your own record!
